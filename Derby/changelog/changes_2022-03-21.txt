ad_hoc_teams_members.java
- Changed columns so that they map to authoring_entities

authoring_entities
- Added columns to map to ad_hoc_teams_members

bookss.java
- renamed books.java to bookss.java
- The reason for the exta 's' in the class name is to differentiate it from the project name.

ad_hoc_teams_members_id
- I changed this attributes to be of type String. That worked, for some reason
