Books.java - This update is meant to address the testing / aesthetics of the program
- Added two System.out.println(); statements at the beginning of the run for most methods
- Added code in most methods to clar the buffer
- Note that red writing in the console DOES NOT always mean there is something wrong
- In the variable delarations, I changed the int data type to Integer

authoring_entities.java
- Added a constructor to initialize the essentials only

Methods Tested
- addWritingGroup
- addIndividualWriter
- addAdHocTeam
- addToTeam: Not sure why it's pausing, but it adds a member
- addPublisher
- addBook: This gives an error, but works
- listInfoMenu(publisher's, books, Writing Groups)
- deleteBook
- updateBook
- listPrimaryKeys
